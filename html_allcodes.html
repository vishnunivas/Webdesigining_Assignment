Aryabhata (Sanskrit: आर्यभट, ISO: Āryabhaṭa) or Aryabhata  (476–550 CE) was the first of the major mathematician-astronomers from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy. His works include the Āryabhaṭīya   and the Arya-siddhanta.
For his explicit mention of the relativity of motion, he also qualifies as a major early physicist.
Aryabhata mentions in the Aryabhatiya that he was 23 years old 3,600 years into the Kali Yuga, but this is not to mean that the text was composed at that time. This mentioned year corresponds to 499 CE, and implies that he was born in 476. Aryabhata called himself a native of Kusumapura or Pataliputra (present day Patna, Bihar).
